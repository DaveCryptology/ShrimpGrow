ShrimPAD?

ShrimPAD is a launchpad for vetted projects only that will allow investors of the BNB chain to safely invest in meme coins, utility projects and NFT collections with high growth potential. 

The ShrimpDAO guardians will be involved in selecting projects listed on ShrimPAD. They will only process applications that completed the listing requirements* ( *To be voted in ShrimpDAO ).
